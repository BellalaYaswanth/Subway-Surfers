# Subway-Surfers

1) Hello all this is a simple python program which tries to use our body as a controller for the Subway Surfers game

2) Here I have used media pipe to detect the body posture

3) then based on the based posture I have stimulated the keyboard input using pyautogui module of the python

4) as single press of the key is not sufficient to make the bot move I have used multithreading concept to simultaneously run different methods

5) In order to run this program in your machine just install the dependencies like opencv, mediapipe, pyautogui, matplotlib and run the project.py file

6) after that stand in front of the camera in center position

7) That's it you are good to go now

8) it can use for all basic commands like left, right, up, down
